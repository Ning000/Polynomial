# Polynomial
This is a function to get the result of adding up two polynomials.

There will be a single line which begins with an integer that represents the length of the polynomial

For example:

1x^4+2x^3+3x^2+4x+5

and

3x^2+2x+1

You can store the number and values of coefficient in two files, which will be 5 1 2 3 4 5 and 3 3 2 1.

The first number is the numbers of coefficient.

Then you will get 5 1 2 6 6 6.
